## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights in the following areas:

- Semantic HTML5 Markup: I prioritized using semantic HTML5 tags to enhance accessibility and maintain a well-structured code. This included utilizing tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` appropriately.

- Flexbox: By employing CSS Flexbox properties like display: flex, justify-content, and align-items, I achieved a responsive and centered design for the component.

- CSS Grid: I leveraged CSS Grid properties such as grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas to create complex and responsive grid structures.

- Mobile-first Workflow: I followed a mobile-first approach, designing and developing the component for mobile devices initially and then enhancing it for larger screens.

- Next.js - React Framework: I utilized Next.js, a React framework, to build the component. This included creating a Next.js project, installing dependencies, and setting up the project's folder structure.

Additionally, I addressed specific user requirements by ensuring the component's layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. I also implemented a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on the following areas:

- Responsive Design: Enhancing my understanding of media queries and advanced techniques for seamless experiences across devices.
- CSS Animation: Exploring CSS animation techniques to create engaging and visually appealing interactions.
- JavaScript Interactivity: Improving my JavaScript skills to add dynamic and interactive elements to components.
- Performance Optimization: Further optimizing code and assets for faster load times.
- Accessibility: Deepening my knowledge of accessibility standards to create inclusive experiences.

### Useful resources

- I found the article titled [A guide to learning CSS Grid by @jonsuh](https://learncssgrid.com/) to be immensely beneficial. It provided a comprehensive guide on CSS Grid and equipped me with the knowledge necessary to successfully implement it in this project.
